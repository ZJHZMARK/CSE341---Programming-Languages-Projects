# CSE341 Winter 2017 Individual Project 1

Due: 11:59PM February 5, 2017 (No Late Days)

Welcome to the first individual project! This project replaces the
usual midterm, and is largely similar in scope to other homeworks in
this course.

## Policies

The main differences between this project and other homeworks are:

- The collaboration policy. You may not discuss this project with
  anyone other than the TAs and the instructor until after the due
  date.
    - Please make all Piazza questions about IP1 private
    - Do not post anything about IP1 in the Slack channel. (You may
      message the TAs or James privately in Slack for quick questions
      if you prefer that to Piazza.)

- The late day policy. Late days may not be used. The deadline is firm.

Otherwise, the policies are as usual. You may use any resources from
the course website, or other resources on SML, etc.

## Overview

In this project you will implement a sequence of programming
languages. The first few languages will be so simple that they will
barely feel like programming languages at all. But by the end, you
will have implemented the core of (a very simplifed version of) SML.

Each language in this project builds on previous ones, so you should
proceed in order. We will often ask you to copy parts of your previous
implementations into the next file and then modify them to implement
the new functionality.

The project is a little bit less well specified than the homeworks
have been. We have given you less starter code than usual, but the
directions should be clear about what the goals are, at least at a
high level. Unlike previous homeworks, we are usually not requiring a
particular implementation strategy (eg, you must use this or that
function, or take these arguments in this order, or use currying,
etc.), so you should feel free to do things "your way". However, we
will still comment and grade on style, so do things your way, but
write them down in a stylish way. :)

## To Get Started

There are five required files, called lang01.sml, lang02.sml, ...,
lang05.sml. Please complete all the problems described in these files
(~ 25 problems total). Open lang01.sml to begin.

## Challenge Problems
