(* Let's start with something barely worthy of calling a programming
   language: arithmetic expressions. *)

(* Problem 1: Define a datatype `expr` to represent arithmetic
   expressions, consisting (for now) of *only* integer constants and
   addition.

   Hint: We've done things like this several times before. *)

(* Problem 2: Define a function `eval` that takes an `expr` and
   evaluates it to an integer. In other words, `eval` should have
   type expr -> int. *)

(* Problem 3: Write a simple test for `eval` by calling it on an
   `expr` of your choosing. Record your test here as a `val` binding
   named `test`. *)
