# CSE341 Winter 2017 Individual Project 2

Due: 11:59PM March 17, 2017 (No Late Days)

Welcome to the second and final individual project! I hope you enjoy
taking it as much as I enjoyed creating it.

## Policies

Remember the course policies about individual projects.

- The collaboration policy. You may not discuss this project with
  anyone other than the TAs and the instructor until after the due
  date.
    - If anyone other than course staff asks you anything about the
      project, the only acceptable response is "I can't talk about it
      until after the due date."
    - Please make all Piazza questions about IP2 private
    - Do not post anything about IP2 in the Slack channel. (You may
      message the TAs or James privately in Slack for quick questions
      if you prefer that to Piazza.)

- The late day policy. Late days may not be used. The deadline is firm.

Otherwise, the policies are as usual. You may use any non-human
resources you like, including materials from the course webpage, or
other resources about the languages we use.

## Overview

This project consists of four problems.

- Problem 1 is an "on-paper" question about types in SML. See
  prob1.md. Please type your answers either in that file, or in a
  separate document in a format of your choice (Word, PDF, or others,
  within reason).

- Problem 2 asks you to implement promises and streams, along with
  some functions that manipulate them, in SML. See prob2.sml.

- Problem 3 introduces the idea of continuations and
  continuation-passing style in Racket, and asks you to use these to
  implement a library for programs that use backtracking. It then asks
  you to use your library to write a Sudoku solver. See prob3.rkt.

- Problem 4 introduces the idea of simulation in Ruby. Simulation
  tasks like this were one of the original motivations for
  object-oriented programming languages. The problem asks you to
  develop a library for writing certain kinds of simulators, and then
  to use the library to develop a simulation to help decide how many
  webservers are required to serve a certain number of requests per
  second. See prob4.rb.

These problems are independent, so you can work on them in any order.

## Unsolicited Advice

On average, these problems are more challenging than a typical
homework problem in this course. This is intentional. I think it is
more interesting to show you new material on this project than to
rehash old material. The mindset you have developed over this quarter
should help you do well on these problems, but I do not expect
everyone to get a perfect score on everything. Be sure to attempt all
the problems, rather than spending all your time being stuck on one of
them.
